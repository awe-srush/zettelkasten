Enable fast and constant feedback cycles throughout all stages of development cycle.
[[e08bf4bf]]

- fail fast
- swarm and solve problems to build new knowledge
- Push quality closer to source.
  - Don't wait for QA to address security.
- Optimize for people down the chain
  - Dev team should work to make program more deployable
  - Work to make others workflows easier while not sacrificing your own.
- Some outcomes:
  - understanding and responding to all customers, internal and external
  - shortening / amplifying all feedback loops
  - embedding knowledge where we need it
- Optimizing MTTR (Mean Time to Repair) (same as MTRS [[5678ad42]])
