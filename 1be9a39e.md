# DevOps Topology Type 7: SRE Team (Google Model)

An explicit 'hand-off' from Development to the team that runs the software, the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team.

The Dev team needs to provide test evidence (logs, metrics, etc) that show the software can be deployed.
Crucially, the **SRE team can reject software** that is operationally substandard, asking the Developers to improve the code before it is put into Production.
Collaboration between Dev and SRE happens around operational criteria but once the SRE team is happy with the code, they (and not the Dev team) support it in Production.

Key point: Good communication, high quality, and easily deployable software can be sufficient.
A healthy DevOps culture does not require every dev team to own _both_ the ongoing operation and the maintanence; just the maintanence is fine.

Can require very strong structures and definitions between Dev, DevOps, SRE, and Ops.
