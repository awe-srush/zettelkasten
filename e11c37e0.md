# Erase Your Darlings

The biggest enemy of [[5678ad42]] in systems is "works of art."

Components of the system that have been hand-crafted over the years that, if failed, would be impossible to reproduce in a predictable time.

Works of art fly in the face of [[ffb366dd]], lowers one's ability to have [[6bb1a622]], and makes it very difficult to have strong [[d99dc068]] while [[f0e1b602]].

Instead, practice [[65c218b2]] (but to an even greater degree).
Seek out things that cause [[64f0558b]] and root them out of the system.
Culturally, this also makes state [[07d3d82a]].

<https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings>, better than [[65c218b2]].
