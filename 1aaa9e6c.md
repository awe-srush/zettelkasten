# Negative vs Positive Hyperbole

Hyperbole is something that can be used when communicating as a generic intensifier; it's often temporal in nature (eg "always", "never").
I'm coining Negative and Positive Hyperbole here to refer to two styles of using it.
Both can be of good/ill intention.
Perhaps a better name would be "indirect" vs "direct"?

I've noticed that healthy relationships see to use positive hyperbole more often than negative hyperbole when communicating.

Example of negative hyperbole:

> Did you not do X becasue Y or because _you never do_ Z?

Example of positive hyperbole:

> I appreciate you for always doing X

Both of these can be negative, and both can be positive.
The difference is how many ways the follow-up can be negative and how likely the message is to be received as intended (hopefully positively).

I think the reason healthy relationships pick Positive/Direct Hyperbole (if at all) is that it's easier to understand and harder to misunderstand.
Which leads to a principle of healthy relationships that one should avoid spending emotional energy on mixed messages.
