# Metrics of Software Delivery

The "golden metrics" of software delivery performance are:

1. Deployment frequency
   - How frequently is the team deploying?
2. Lead time for changes
   - How long does it take to get code successfully running in production?
3. Time to restore service
   - How long does it take to recover from an incident?
4. Change failure rate
   - What percentage of changes to production result in degraded service?
