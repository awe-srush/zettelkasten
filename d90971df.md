# Tools vs Solutions

A problem that I see a lot is an unnecessary conflation of certain tools and the problems those tools try to solve.
For example, one might want a "reliable development environment" and one possible method of trying to achieve that is docker.

Unfortunately, it's easier to talk about tools than it is about the actual problems they address and the methods they use to do so.
