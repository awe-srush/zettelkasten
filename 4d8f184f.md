# Focus, Flow, Joy

  - tech debt not tracked consistently across teams, value streams
  - risk work (eg security) also not tracked
- symptom: Amount of work requested is consistently too high because
  - most work is not tracked (eg tech debt)
- Improve focus by lowering the load
- remove delivery impediments
- aim for joy and happiness and successful cycle
