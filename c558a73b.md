# A Spoonful of Convention Makes the DevOps Go Down

Seriously.
So many tools make the mistake of allowing _everything_ to be configurable.
Every configurable option is a choice that I have to make and a setting that I have to maintain.
Cut it out.

It's 100% fine if my code has to be in `src` instead of (pick one of infinite possible setups).
It's also 100% fine if there's a lot of flexibility, as long as I can opt out of that flexibility and have a sane upgrade path should I ever need it.

see: <https://vector-of-bool.github.io/docs/dds/design.html>.
Chose to go with very strict convention over configuration approach.
Specifically to combat "I'm special and everyone else needs to deal with it" syndrome in C/C++ libraries.
