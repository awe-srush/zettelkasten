# Configuration

Part of the [[c9ed1721]].

Store config in the [[310a93f5]]. Don't attach semantic meaning to groups of configuration

- Facilitates consistent [[d3562ede]] across all potential [[310a93f5]], including exploraory ones
  - Grouping confs together creates [[f654ef20]]+combinatorial explosion of environments.
  - Keeping configs individual results in no [[f654ef20]] and linear growth of [[310a93f5]].
- [[05e161ab]]
- [[[65c218b2]]]
- [[[ba270fd9]]]
  - Helps prevent [[[64f0558b]]]
  - IaC vs IaD. [[[a600409c]]] is preferable because it is statically analyzable.
