# Aretê

> "Aretê implies a respect for the wholeness or oneness of life, and a consequent dislike of specialization. It implies a contempt for efficiency - or rather a much higher idea of efficiency, an efficiency which exists not in one department of life but in life itself."
> ~ Pirsig, Robert M. (2009-04-10). Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (p. 360). Harper Collins, Inc.. Kindle Edition.

Teams and Organizations should optimize for Aretê.
Teams should be staffed with people who seek excellence in work and in achieving the team's goals.

Management is enabling people to be free to pursue Aretê.

This notion of excellence is fundamentally tied to the act of living up to one's full potential.

Aretê is also tied to knowledge.
In greek philosophy, the highest human potential is the theoretical study of knowledge.
