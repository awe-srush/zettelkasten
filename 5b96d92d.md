# Theory of Constraints

A small number of constraints prevents any management system from achieving more of its goals

- Have a focusing process to identify constraint; then restructure to address.
- Fundamental assumption: Throughput accounting can measure success for organization
  - Throughput: Rate at which goals are achieved
  - Operational Expense: Money spent achieving goals
  - Investment/Inventory: Money invested in system
- Focus Process Loop
  - Identify constraint
  - Decide how to exploit it
    - Seeing constraints as opportunity not a problem.
  - Subordinate everything to the above decision
    - Make sure all parts of the system are tuned to support the constraint
    - (Most important yet hardest step)
  - Alleviate the constraint
- Thinking process
  - What needs changing?
  - How should it change?
  - What action will change it?
