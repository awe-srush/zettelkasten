# Deployment Pipelines

Goal: Any deploy to any env is a fully automated process that can be performed on demand trivially.

Including:

- Deploy to local machine (ie local testing)
- Deploy to pre-existing testing environment
- Deploy to brand new environment
- Deploy to new/existing dynamically specified environment
- Deploy to production

## Stages

> Key idea: Tiered levels of testing to enable near immediate feedback on code that's changed.

> Key idea: Self service deployment ensures deployment to dev is the same as to production. Taking the fear out of deployment

> Key idea: Manual testing will always be required, but by automating the deployment of environments, it can be made fully reproducible and methodical.

- Commit stage: only a few minutes to run
  - must be fixed immediately if fails.
- Acceptance stage: more comprehensive test suite
  - Once they pass these, and all other automated tests, self-service deployment is possible
- Have ability to run interactive and/or exploratory tests/envs. Integration, capacity, etc.
  - Self service deployment,using same method as deploy to staging and/or production
- Deploy to staging
- Deploy to production

  - Interesting because it solves a [[d99dc068]] problem rather than a raw infrastructure problem.
  - Not the same as "merge trains" a la gitlab in [[dcc7c00c]]
