# Convention over Configuration

Used as a way to get rid of boilerplate. Not bad, but generally a local maximum.

The better solution is to figure out how to take the boilerplate and wrap it [[fe376a30]] instead of in convention.
This avoids implicit configuration while also avoiding specifying out the vast amount of unnecessary and irrelevant configuration.

That said, [[[c558a73b]]]
