# Performer Metrics

Metrics in this sense are really a more formal and principled way of reflecting on [[d624dd86]] as a way of achieving [[01682ccb]] and [[545ff375]].
They won't be effective or even be possible to truly obtain until the environment is an empowering one [[40f8856b]].
Put another way, performer metrics are a way to ask the question "if one wants to increase [[3030602c]], how can they do so most effectively?"

The main question here, I think, is when a performer encounters work, what can they do with it?
How can they embrace it?
And how can they judge the quality of their interaction with that work?
Much focus is already placed on what happenswhat happens after a performer has already acclimated to a project;
Focusing more explicitly on the meta-interaction between the performer and their work is valuable.
So is thinking about the [[fc2903e4]] process.

## Time to interactive

> Never a fire without the flame, never a flame without the spark

- Playing around with a project, or demo, mini lessons, etc. ([[f0e1b602]])
- Contributing ([[6bb1a622]])
- Testing ([[ffb366dd]])
- Sharing ([[01682ccb]], [[06e5698f]])

## Time to joy

> A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down

- How easy is it to automate the parts of your work that don't bring you joy? ([[40f8856b]])
- How easy is it to match work to people who enjoy that work the most? ([[30b3f2cc]])
- How easy is it to make difficult aspects of the work more joyful ([[3030602c]])

## Time to typo

> Is your username really `foobar'); DROP TABLE Production;--`?

- [[2bc613de]]
- [[6bb1a622]]
- [[c0982124]]
- [[3e3c8463]]

## I'm So HEALTH Even A Little Thinky Hat

> The only way to wisdom is in knowing you know nothing

- Finding out what can be done better
- Finding out what's currently suboptimal
- Finding out what causes friction for others (without necessarily asking them to perform routine self-reflection)
