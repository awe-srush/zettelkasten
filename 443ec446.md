# Mapping out Build Systems in terms of Rebuilder + Scheduler Strategies

| Rebuild strategy         | Topological scheduler | Restarting scheduler | Suspending scheduler |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| dirty bit                | make                  | excel                |                      |
| verifying traces         | ninja, docker         |                      | shake                |
| constructive traces      | cloudbuild            | bazel                | cloud shake          |
| deep constructive traces | buck                  |                      | nix                  |

Some build systems don't map cleanly to rebuild+scheduler.
For example, even though docker is a verifying trace + topological scheduler, it only allows for a linear chain of dependnecies and so doesn't really "have" a scheduler.

Other build systems that don't fit the mold are [[ccdbe6d6]]
