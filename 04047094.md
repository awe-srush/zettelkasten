# Practical Implementation Tips for Secrets

- Name secrets according to what they're for, not who they're for
  - eg: `dockerhub_username` rather than `tokenFor_$projectName_$VCS`
- Name secrets in a way that their names can be programatically looked up
  - eg: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "${{ secrets[format('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_{0}', env.CACHES_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID)] }}"`
    This is a _really_ good name for a few subtle reasons. Detailed in the rust github repo.
    ```
    # AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEYs are stored in GitHub's secrets storage, named
    # AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_[[[keyid]]]. Including the key id in the name allows to
    # rotate them in a single branch while keeping the old key in another
    # branch, which wouldn't be possible if the key was named with the kind
    # (caches, artifacts...).
    CACHES_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: the_cache_id
    ARTIFACTS_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: the_artifact_id
    ```
