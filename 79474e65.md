# Keyboards

What an ideal keyboard would look like for me.

Goals: maximize comfort, speed, reliability. Minimize latency.

Latency:

Components to keyboard latency are:

- Port type
- Debounce
  - optical, capacitive and hall effect switches don' require debounce
- cables reporting
- switch travel
  - Choc switches are 1.5mm actuation. Choc minis are 1.2mm
- scan matrix
  - Direct wiring can make scan matrix not required.
  - Does this actually speed up things or is it possible that a matrix can be sufficiently fast?

  - Release point is higher than actuation point. Capacitative buckling springs tend to have this.
  - Results in much less debouncing needed but very high hysteresis makes double tapping keys more difficult.
