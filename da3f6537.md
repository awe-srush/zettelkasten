# DevOps Maturity Timeline

- bla bla
- standard envs
- bla bla
- flexiblity

From state of devops report.

What if the timeline is more focused on actually "achieving standardization" and then "flexiblity and performance" not as a means but as a method.
Can we walk the timeline without actually enforcing consistent environments?
