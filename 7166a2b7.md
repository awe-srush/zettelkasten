# Implicit Social Structures

If a social structure is left implicit, people will naturally tend towards what they're most familiar with.
In part because people assume others are more like themselves than they actually are, as well as people continuing to perform learned behavior as their default without some external force suggesting they do otherwise.
This can lead to implicit social structures embedding the biases of the group much like machine learning on datasets will pick up on biases inside the data sets unless great care is taken to unbias the data and crosstrain the ML algorithm.
