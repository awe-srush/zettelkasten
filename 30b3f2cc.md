# Effective Organizational Culture

| power-oriented          | rule-oriented             | performance-oriented |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| low cooperation         | modest cooperation        | high cooperation     |
| messengers shot         | messengers neglected      | messengers trained   |
| responsiblities shirked | narrow responsiblities    | risks are shared     |
| bridging discouraged    | bridging tolerated        | bridging encouraged  |
| failure -> scapegoating | failure -> justice        | failure -> enquiry   |
| novelty crushed         | novelty leads to problems | novelty implemented  |

An effective culture is one that processes information effectively.
Things like [[a670f1d7]] are essential to that goal.
Another powerful tool is turning failure into a positive through inquiry;
indeed, effective organizations regularly cause controlled failures in order to learn from them.

If information can be processed effectively, then a culture of continuous processing of information leads to a culture of continuous improvement.
