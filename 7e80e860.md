# Continuous Monitoring

- Logging
  - Gives you a continuous stream of data about your businessâ€™ critical components.
  - Application logs, infrastructure logs, and audit logs all provide important data that helps teams learn and improve products.
- Monitoring
  - Provides a level of intelligence and interpretation to the raw data provided in logs and metrics.
  - With advanced tooling, monitoring can provide teams with correlated insights beyond what the raw data provides.
- Alerting
  - Provides proactive notifications to respective teams to help them stay ahead of major issues.
  - When effectively implemented, these alerts not only let you know when something has gone wrong, but can also provide teams with critical debugging information to help solve the problem quickly.
- Tracing
  - Takes logging a step further, providing a deeper level of application performance and behavioral insights that can greatly impact the stability and scalability of applications in production environments.
