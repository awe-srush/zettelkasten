# DevOps Topology Type 3: Ops as Infrastructure-as-a-Service

The Ops team acts as an implementator and provider of a private cloud for tooling and infrastructure needs.
Individual teams and projects then have certain Devs who take advantage of the infrastructure to do the "[[9db9e634]]" tasks.

Works well with organizations with a large amount of products, who have a traditional Ops department.

Crucially, any potential effectiveness loss here is the loss of direct collaboration with Ops people;
the gain is ability to more rapidly iterate before trying to stabilize on a Type 1 topology.
