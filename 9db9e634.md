DevOps historically defied definition. It was supposed to be holistic and about the people and what was right for them rather than what was right for some externally imposed process.

A culture where people, regardless of title or background, work together to imagine, develop, deploy and operate a system
It's not important which definition of DevOps you adopt. It is important that you have one.

IT procures and implements any necessary hardware and software to support DevOps recommendation. IT will manage updates and patching to the underlying systems and services.
DevOps builds up the rest of the supporting elements on top of that infrastructure to support projects broadly.
Having the separation of duties here makes it so that DevOps can focus on project needs and concerns while IT can maintain its focus on Business Continuity, Compliance and Security concerns.

Where does IT end and DevOps begin?
“It Depends”™

DORA Report:

Outcomes of DevOps are:

- less burnout
- less rework
- less deployment pain
- software reliability
- development/person/hour increases

"Organizational performance measures the ability of an organization to achieve commercial and non-commercial goals."
Years of analysis show that organizations with strong software delivery performance are twice as likely to exceed their goals.

Aspects of DevOps:

- platform
- known best solutions/strategies:
  - getting things done in gitlab/github
  - dealing with secrets
  - dealing with git submodules
  - avoiding git submodules
  - best way to X
  - field guide to picking tech in a stack and what to think about
  - Good mental models for X
    - documentation
    - types of testing

Tool Chain Stuff.

The DevOps movement addresses the dysfunction that results from organizations composed of functional silos.
Thus, creating another functional silo that sits
between dev and ops is clearly a poor (and ironic) way to try and solve these
problems.
Devops proposes instead strategies to create better collaboration
between functional silos, or doing away with the functional silos altogether
and creating cross-functional teams (or some combination of these approaches

Value by the numbers:

30x more frequent code changes
200x shorter lead times
60x fewer failures
168x faster recovery

high performer: 21% time on unplanned and rework
medium performer: 32% unplanned and rework
low performer: 27% unplanned and rework

high performer: 49% time on new work
medium performer: 34% time on new work
low performer: 38% time on new work

"It gets worse before it gets better."
Low performers rack up technical debt, medium performers deploy more frequently

ROI:
excess rework (unplanned work + rework)
Cost of excess rework = Technical staff size × Average salary × Benefits multiplier × Percentage of technical staff time spent on excess rework

Excess rework difference between high and low/med performers is about 10%.

DevOps is a culture mindset, not a tech stack.

> Dev: I’m gonna do it like this  
> Ops: If you do it that way it will blow up when we try to use NFS on Solaris  
> Dev: Oh, what if we did it this way?  
> Ops: That would work, but still could be flaky and result in us both getting paged at 3AM.  
> Dev: I don’t want to get paged at 3AM, what do you suggest? (slides over pairing keyboard)  
> Ops: Let’s do it this way.

Months of rework avoided.

> At the O’Reilly Velocity Conference, two Flickr employees—John Allspaw,
> senior vice president of technical operations, and Paul Hammond, director of
> engineering—gave a now-famous presentation titled, "10+ Deploys per Day: Dev
> and Ops Cooperation at Flickr."
>
> The presentation had a dramatic flair to it, as Allspaw and Hammond would
> role-play the contentious interplay between representatives of Development
> and Operations during a typical software deployment, along with all the
> finger-pointing/blame that goes on, such as, “It’s not my code, it’s your
> machines!” Their presentation made the case that the only rational way
> forward is for application development and operations activities to be
> seamless, transparent and fully integrated.
>
> Over time, this presentation has reached legendary status, and is
> historically viewed as the seminal moment in time for that called out to the
> IT industry for methods that we now know as DevOps.
