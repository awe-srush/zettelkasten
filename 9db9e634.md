# DevOps

> DevOps: A culture where people, regardless of title or background, work together to imagine, develop, deploy and operate a system.
> -Ken Mugrage

DevOps is a culture mindset, not a tech stack.

> Dev: I’m gonna do it like this
> Ops: If you do it that way it will blow up when we try to use NFS on Solaris
> Dev: Oh, what if we did it this way?
> Ops: That would work, but still could be flaky and result in us both getting paged at 3AM.
> Dev: I don’t want to get paged at 3AM, what do you suggest? (slides over pairing keyboard)
> Ops: Let’s do it this way.

Months of rework avoided.

At the O’Reilly Velocity Conference, two Flickr employees—John Allspaw, senior vice president of technical operations, and Paul Hammond, director of engineering—gave a now-famous presentation titled, “10+ Deploys per Day: Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr.”
The presentation had a dramatic flair to it, as Allspaw and Hammond would role-play the contentious interplay between representatives of Development and Operations during a typical software deployment, along with all the finger-pointing/blame that goes on, such as, “It’s not my code, it’s your machines!” Their presentation made the case that the only rational way forward is for application development and operations activities to be seamless, transparent and fully integrated.
Over time, this presentation has reached legendary status, and is historically viewed as the seminal moment in time for that called out to the IT industry for methods that we now know as DevOps.
