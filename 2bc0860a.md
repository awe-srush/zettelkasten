# What Will The Next 10 Years Of Continuous Delivery Look Like?

- Everyone does test driven development.
- Some people keep the tests after they pass.
- CD is about the continuous delivery of ideas.
- CD things like IaC, testing strategy, etc., iterative planning, team structure, etc., are all of three categories:
  - (measures of success)
  - culture performance
  - technical performance
  - organiational performance
- <https://www.devops-research.com/research.html>
- outcomes `->` {knowledge gap: what we know vs what we'd like to know} `->` plans `->` {alignment gap: what we want people to do vs what they do} `->` actions `->` {effect gap: expected vs actual outcome} `->` outcomes
  - work in smaller steps

## work culture:

how does company view IT?

|                 | cost center  | asset                 | partner        | enabler (best structure) |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| focus on        | cost         | Return on Investment  | business value | speed and innovation     |
| CIO reporting   | CFO          | COO                   | CDO            | CEO                      |
| common strategy | outsource IT | harmonize/rationalize | insource it    | IT = business            |
| levers          | cost cutting | economies of scale    |                | **economies of speed**   |

## Software Development

- software development is learning + managing complexity. Optimize for these things.
- Engineering is applying science to solving problems
- Apply the scientific method in a feedback loop = devops

| product design and development                         | product delivery                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| create new products and services                       | enable fast flow from dev to production                    |
| feature design may require work never performed before | integration, test, deloy, performed as quickly as possible |
| estimates are highly uncertain                         | cycle times well known and predictable                     |
| outcomes have high variability                         | outcomes have low variability                              |

- Column A is the input to the engine created in column B
- Most of your ideas will be bad ideas, so you need to be able to iterate on them rapidly
- "why don't you measure lead time from idea to implementation?" You're crossing two domains. From idea to delivery. Don't cross the streams.
- Are you doing CI?
  - All developer branches are merged into main trunk at least once a day
  - If master breaks it's fixed within 10 minutes
- You need an emotional response to drive change from the executive level of an organization.
- Use a metaphor of video chats: if the other person on the other side is frozen, you're not getting that immediate feedback that you need to be able to carry on a conversation effectively and it destroys your ability to share information with others.
- Think of a value stream like a stream of salt coming out of a salt shaker: that's CD. Being able to say "say when" as a cutoff point is a huge game changer in CEOs being able to reason about what things are going to look like 6 months down the road.
