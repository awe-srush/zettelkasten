# Local Environments and CI

Pipelines and CI systems are super hampered if they can't be used to run stuff locally.
What's the point of having a testsuite and a test runner and automating the shit out of it if you can't even use it when developing? (eg the vast majority of the time)

Ooh, ok, so tekton has this ability to one-off run tasks, and specify one-off tasks, and wants to gain the ability to let people locally run tasks in the CI on demand.
What that says to me is that really, the ideal scenario is for the local computer to be able to run the CI system entirely.
Or if the CI can support a client/server model, the local computer can act as a client for on-demand local tasks so that they can be run whenever.
