1. Type

   - app code
   - services code
   - infrastructure

2. Frequency/Size

   - deploys per day (app/services/infra)
   - LoC change per deploy

3. Results of the change

   - incident frequency
   - incedent size/severity
   - root cause
   - time to detect
   - time to resolve

Incident tracking: The how doesn't matter. See [[a670f1d7]]

> Change:Incident ratio is important to track for the sole reason that humans
> will irrationally make a permanent connection between the two.
