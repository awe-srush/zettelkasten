# Engineering Concerns of Build Systems

Many of the engineering concerns revolve around a few central areas:

- Making it easier to write correct builds in the build system DSL
- Making build systems more performant
- Making build systems more responsive to users
- Making build systems more ammenable to interactive use

- Untracked dependencies
- Non-determinism
- Volatility (rules that change every build, eg phony rules)
- key-dependent value types allow for more type safe representation of complicated tasks such as oracles
- tasks that produce multiple outputs
- self tracking: recomputing tasks if the task itself changes
- build systems with file watch modes as optimization at scale.
  - some tasks may become obsolete and require canceling/restarting
  - concurrent modifications of build outputs can introduce errors
- propagation of changes:
  - pull vs push model [^reflex]
- query based architecture, ala [^rc]
- underlying file system
  - changing the file system can make certain operations much more expensive or cheaper to perform.

Additionally, how do you get really performant incremental builds in a CI system?
Google bazel does this along with google's internal CI/CD by basically never invalidating its cache, building only remotely, and having the latest code available.
It's not even close to "stateless".

Specific to cloud implementations, additional concerns are:

- communication: sending minimum amount of information. Optimize with respect to build system invariants.
- offloading: building remotely with remote builders
- eviction: how to purge old items from the store.
- shallow builds: building an end target without materializing intermediate values.
  - Have a weaker correctness property: Instead of demanding all keys reachable from target match. Only require matches for input keys + target
  - buck allows for maximum shallowness, being deep constructive tracing (like nix), this has the advantage that you can get any build result from buck in _one_ API call.

Deep constructive traces have incorrect results in the presence of non-determinism whereas other cloud build systems just get fewer cache hits.
