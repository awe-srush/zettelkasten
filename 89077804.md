# Build System Schedulers

## Topological

Precomputes a linear order of tasks and then executes them in that order

- Applicative or weaker. No static dependencies.
- Minimal

## Restarting

build tasks in arbitrary order. If task wants an out-of-date dependency, abort it and build that dependency

- To minimize restarts, bazel stores most recent task dependency info and computes linear order from that
- excel stores discovered task order and uses it as starting point for next build
- Monadic or weaker
- Not minimal

## Suspending

build dependencies when requested, suspending tasks if necessary

- Suspension can be implemented with blocking threads or CPS. CPS requires the build script to be architectured correclty, which shake does automatically.
- Suspension is theoretically optimal but only better than restarting if the cost of avoided duplicate work outweighs the cost of of suspending tasks.
- Monadic or weaker
- Minimal
