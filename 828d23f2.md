# Collaborative Web

No collaboration model is without its flaws, and the Collaborative Web does have some negatives.
These don't stop it from modeling an [[30b3f2cc]]; rather, it shows the different priorities.

- It is intentionally not designed to explicitly make workflows "easier" or employees "happier"
  - Optimizing for easier workflows doesn't have the necessary context to actually work. It also can result in never accomplishing _meaningful_ work.
  - Prescribing a workflow to obtain happiness is at odds with the personal reflection needed for individuals to find their own [[3030602c]].
  - [[4d8f184f]] cannot be algorithmically obtained; it's a culture that is cultivated, much like [[9db9e634]].
- Does not have a mechanism to disseminate information. It merely suggests that information needs to be available.
  - This works well with companies of a distributed nature that choose to prioritize Availability in the [[2202edf0]].
  - This is in contrast to companies like Amazon which prioritize Availability or Google which prioritize Consistency with very little tolerance for divergence.
  - However, it does make it hard to have [[06e5698f]].

Potential improvements would come not from _prescribing_ any particular procedure or workflow; that would de-prioritize partition tolerance.
Instead, giving more explicit effort towards avoiding unnecessary divergence would allow for more readily [[06e5698f]].
This opens the door for propagating information across communication channels and making it easier to suggest strategies to optimize [[2bc613de]].
