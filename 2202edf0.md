  - Whether a system favors yield or harvest (or is even capable of reducing harvest) tends to be an outcome of its design.

[[30b3f2cc]]s that make the "what" and the "how" more explicit, such as [[582985e0]] or [[61dca3ef]], are ones that prioritize Consistency or Availability.

They offer more advice on ways to improve the process as part of an emphasis on [[01682ccb]] _as a means of_ [[4d8f184f]], rather than for the sake of facilitating [[3030602c]].

todo:

- Relating whether a system optimizes for harvest or yield to software engineering.
- Relating CAP tradeoffs to software cultures:
  - google: consistency over availability
  - amazon: availability over consistency
- If a company tolerates divergence, consistency and availability can be maintained even with partition failures.
- Most companies do not tolerate divergence, which often manifests itself in not granting their employees sufficient autonomy to succeed.
