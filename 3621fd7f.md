# Ignorance

It's fundamentally important for humans to be vastly ignorant of almost everything.
We are designed to filter out the vast amount of reality; we see only a small segment of the electromagnetic spectrum, we hear only a small part of possible sound waves, and our noses aren't very advanced.
If we couldn't process this information efficiently enough, our brains would fry from sensory overload.
This plays into our brain's necessity around evolving a set of biases with which to quickly and more efficiently make sense of partial information.
