# Symmathesetic AretÃª

I have thoughts. Lots of thoughts. They never stop thinking. Never stop thunking.

This is a zettelkasten.
It's intended to be an ever evolving snapshot of the inner workings of my brain.
If you're looking for coherent thoughts and well polished ideas, this isn't the place.
I hope to spend some time every day working through this.

You'll notice that the writing style in here is a mix of "authoritative sounding" academic narrative, inquisitive, and a more personable explanatory voice.
I'd like to remind myself to write more in a personable voice that's more honest about my actual expertise level, rather than defaulting to an authoritary reference voice even if I'm not personally an authoritary reference on a subject.
(This is more of a thing I'd like to get better at in general).

Whenever I remember, I've tried to list references to things, but there's quite a lot of internalized knowledge I'm likely not citing yet; that'll improve over time.
The general idea with the references is to embed in this zettelkasten the different "types" of notes and hopefully differentiate between them better.

- Fleeting
- Literary
- Permanent
- Reference Material

Note to self:

- write super high level stuff
- make it slightly more specific
- relate back to above
- avoids eg https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-tech-test-automation being seen as unapplicable to field X because triangle has UI testing while not being so abstract it doesn't provide real guidance
