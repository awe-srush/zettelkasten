# Build System Rebuilders

Decides if a scheduled task is already up to date or not.

- dirty bit: file system modified time, actual dirty bit, etc.
  - can be minimal, but difficult to support early cutoff
  - useful to reduce memory consumption
- verifying traces: hash dependencies. Rebuild if changed.
  - for suspending schedulers with dynamic dependencies, often the build steps are performed in order to check if a key needs to be rebuilt.
- verifying step traces: instead of hashing dependencies, store built+changed time for each key and list of dependency keys (without hashes)
  - stores less data than verifying traces
  - allows values to be considered equal without being bit-for-bit equal
  - slightly different early cutoff semantics
    - if a subset of target is built, changed, then reverted, verifying traces do not rebuild but verifying step traces will.

deep constructive traces are merely constructive traces that consider n=infinity levels of transitive dependencies.
constructive traces are the special case of n=1.
deep constructive traces can pick any n to regain some early cutoff at the cost of more expensive shallow builds.
Any n > 1 requires determinstic builds
