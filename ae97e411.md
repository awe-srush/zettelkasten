# Don't Special Case Administrative Tasks

Part of the [[c9ed1721]]

Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes, but don't special-case one-off tasks.

- Facilitates using a consistent [[05e161ab]] when [[f0e1b602]]
- By making all changes as easy to do as an ad-hoc command, the need for stateful, non-reproducible, and non-verifiable maintanence disappears.
- Avoids [[014823cb]] and subsequently increases [[8136240b]]

Kubernetes uses the concept of sidecar containers and init containers to perform some of these tasks..
