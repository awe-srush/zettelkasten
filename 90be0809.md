Caution: Flow metrics, like anything else, are not a perfect solution [[[4d8f184f]]].
A combination of them along with other ways of thinking about the [[5a328c3e]] are required.

- Flow Velocity: Is value delivery accelerating
  - number of flow items of each type completed over period of time
- Flow Distribution: Helps prioritize type of work
  - ratio of flow items completed over window of time
- Flow time: Identifies Time to Value
  - Time for flow items to go from start to complete
- Flow efficiency: identify waste
  - ratio of active time vs wait time out of total flow time
- Flow load: monitor utilization of value streams
  - number of flow items in progress in a value stream
- Related to Theory of Constraints Measuring Throughput:

  - Net Profit: throughput minus operating expenses
  - Return on Investment: net profit divided by investment
  - Productivity: throughput divided by operating expenses
  - Investment Turns: throughput divided by investment
