# Questions about Build Systems

- Is there a hidden underlying abstraction between memoization, self-adjusting computation, and build systems? FRP?
- Are CI/CD systems more naturally an instance of FRP than build systems?
- Is the difference between FRP and something like Shake really just the pull vs push based model?
- Is it how they view the world and model state?
- Are FRP and build systems different? Are they reducible to each other?
