# Software Engineering as a Team Focus

- [[0b0724e4]]
- [[61dca3ef]]: Solve the "getting code into production" problem
- [[582985e0]]: Solve the "empower teams with data" problem
- Related to [[e08bf4bf]]
- [[8c5ca5ba]] is a way of fostering creative thinking
  - The concept of breaking people out of cognitive biases such as binary thinking is inherent in all of these
- Overall goal seems to be "let smart people be smart, let people do good things, and foster both as well as you can"
  - But not always... This might be the overall goal of Flow vs "in general"
- [O-Ring Theory suggests that it's important to match qualities.](https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/11/11/the-o-ring-theory-of-devops/)
  - Goes along with "subordinate everything to above decision"
  - Hiring rockstar developer doesn't fix problems if problems are elsewhere.
  - Same as Amdahl's Law
  - Applies when:
    - Production depends on completing a series of tasks
    - Failure or quality reduction of any one task reduces the value of the entire product
    - You can't substitute quantity for quality

  - Theory of Constraints vs "Lean"
    - ToC identifies constraints and pushes past them
    - Lean is about improving flow, minimizing waste, etc.
    - Complimentary
