# Dynamic Cross-project Pipelines

Rather than force code structure to be in a monorepo so that everything has the same context, one can get that same context by developing a CI system that has support for dynamic context.
That, along with rule execution and constraint solving (a la prolog), allow for creating a CI system that allows for dynamic creation of cross-project `(environment,context)` tuples for use with testing.
This feature becomes invaluable when coordinating large sweeping refactors across multiple repos without the use of extensive people-hours of testing and dark-releases with feature flags.
Even with said feature-flags, it allows the coordination of the CI to be done much easier (like with branch names as a trigger).

[Briareus](https://github.com/kquick/briareus) is the only build system that I know of with this property.
