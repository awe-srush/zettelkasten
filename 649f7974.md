# Nix vs Docker

|                             | Nix                          | Docker                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application domain          | Package management           | Process/service management                                             |
| Storage units               | Package build results        | File system changes                                                    |
| Storage model               | Isolated Nix store paths     | Layers + union file system                                             |
| Component addressing        | Hashes computed from inputs  | Hashes computed from a layer's contents                                |
| Service/process management  | Unsupported                  | First-class feature                                                    |
| Package management          | First class support          | Delegated responsibility to a distro's package manager                 |
| Development environments    | nix-shell                    | Create image with dependencies + run shell session in container        |
| Build management (images)   | Dockerfile                   | dockerTools.buildImage {}                                              |
|                             |                              | dockerTools.buildLayeredImage {}                                       |
| Build management (packages) | First class function support | Implementer's responsibility, can be simulated                         |
| Build environment purity    | Many precautions taken       | Only images provide some reproducibility, implementer's responsibility |
| Full source traceability    | Yes (on Linux)               | No                                                                     |
| OS support                  | Many UNIX-like systems       | Linux (real system or virtualized)                                     |
