# Flow: Systems Thinking

Main idea: Viewing flow of work as one continuous system that can be refined and optimized

- Emphasize performance of entire system vs just specific silo of work/dept
  - Make work visible
- Not just inside a project but cross project
- Can everyone easily see what everyone else is working on?
- Can one team easily learn from another team?
  - Limiting work in progress
- Really, minimize multi tasking and context switching
  - Reducing batch sizes: idea behind two week sprints
  - Reducing hand-offs between teams.
- Tight communication so that hand-off isn't big deal
  - Identify and remove constraints and waste
- Test setup, environments, overly tight architecture?
- Manual work, heroics, context-switching
  - Some outcomes:
    - never passing a known defect to downstream work centers
    - never allowing local optimization to create global degradation
    - always seeking to increase flow
    - always seeking to achieve profound understanding of the system
