One can also think of this as a matter of expressing cross-cutting concerns without conflating implementation details.[^c2]
That is, expressing the set of possible manifestations of a certain type shouldn't be necessarily tied to expressing the set of possible operations on a type.

**To rephrase:**

> "Can we add both rows and columns to this matrix without changing any existing code or sacrificing type safety?"

|        | operation 1 | operation 2 | ... |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- | --- |
| case 1 | impl c1+o1  | impl c1+o2  | ... |
| case 2 | impl c2+o1  | impl c2+o2  | ... |
| ...    | ...         | ...         | ... |

**The key requirements here are:**

1. You have a datatype defined by cases.

   eg (for Haskell)

   ```haskell
   data Type = Type -- "row"
   a :: Type -> _ -- "column"
   ```

   or (for Java)

   ```java
   public class Type[[[T]]] { // "row"
     public T a(); // "column"
   }
   ```

2. You want to add new functionality to the program in both directions
   - Adding new cases to the datatype. This is trivial with Java (with inheritance), but not possible naively in Haskell.
   - Adding new functions which work with the datatype. Conversely, trivial in Haskell, but not in Java.
3. Crucially, the two constraints are that the extension can happen
   - _without_ modifying existing code
   - _without_ compromising static type safety

Interestingly, Java and Haskell both have ways of solving the problem, but they're much clunkier than the normal way of dealing with things.
So in a sense, if one wants to optimize for the least changing of legacy code when changing or extending it, it's very helpful to think of _how_ the codebase is expected to change.
