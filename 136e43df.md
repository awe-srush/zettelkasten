# CI/CD: A Holistic Approach

> CI is the automation of self-validating good explanations.
> It's fundamentally about sociotechnical feedback loops.

## Outline

- Intro (2min)
  - Hi, I'm Jared, I do DevOps.
  - I'm a bit of an oxymoron
    - DevOps is not a position (says the DevOps hire)
    - DevOps has no true definition (says someone about to define it)
  - What brings us here today? Needing more DevOps. But what is that really?
  - Brief outline
    - Theory (18mins)
      - What is DevOps (3mins)
      - Where did DevOps come from? (4mins)
      - What is CI/CD? (1mins)
      - The Nature of Software Delivery (10mins)
    - Practical (40mins)
      - How to tighten feedback loops (10mins)
      - Demo (20mins)
      - Questions (10mins)
- What is DevOps
  - > A culture where people, regardless of title or background, work together to imagine, develop, deploy and operate a system.  
    > \- Ken Mugrage
  - The core of DevOps revolves around refining sociotechnical feedback loops
  - See also: Symmathesy
- Where did DevOps come from?
  - Slow feedback loops made development impossible
    - "It's not the infrastructure, it's the code!"
    - "It's not the code, it's the infrastructure!"
  - 10+ deploys a day at Flickr
    - Insight: Making change less painful requires **more** than cooperation from Devs, Security, and Ops
      - Devs need to consider Ops and Security needs
      - Ops and Security need to enable and think like Devs
      - Without a cultural mindset in place, not much else can happen
    - Insight: Change is Entropy
      - Explicit and controlled change. Desire Idempotence, Immutability, Reproducibility.
      - Similar to how Haskell and Rust make side effects and mutation easy to reason about
    - Insight: Failure is fundamental to the learning process.
      - Prioritize learning how to respond over preventing failure
    - Insight: The customer/performer relationship fundamentally requires change.
      - Customer expectations, performer understanding, X/Y problem, etc.
      - This is a feedback loop that requires explicit attention
      - Optimize The Workflow
  - Repetition is for robots, not humans
    - Automate the validation of Good Explanations
      - The what??
- What is CI?
  - The automation of self-validating good explanations.
  - Ok, what are those?
- Nature of Software Delivery
  - Good explanations
  - Self-validating good explanations
  - It's Symmathesy all the way down
- How to tighten feedback loops
  - In Development Environments
    - Incremental builds
    - File watching test runners that only run failed/changed tests
  - In CI
    - Put everything into the repository that's required to run CI + release changes
    - Automate the build and release processes
    - Have layered stages of validation
      - The pipeline for every commit should take a few minutes at the most (static analysis, linting, unit tests)
      - The acceptance stage can be more comprehensive. Results should be available within a reasonable timeframe.
        - Once code is "accepted", consider it deployed (not released).
  - In the workflow
    - Lightweight code review process
    - Synchronous code review
- Best Practices for Pipelines
  - Build the binary only once
  - Build the minimal amount of stuff
  - Fail fast when possible
  - Only run relevant tests if possible
- Demo: CI + Dev Env for example library and app
  - Go over the holistic aspects of this too
  - Evolving it from "Jared do the thing" to a Symmathesy
- Questions

CI starts with the development environment.
If your local environment isn't sane, how can you expect to make progress? To reason about things?

What is the one thing that you want people to take away from your talk?
Formulate it as a sentence.
This idea shouldn’t be longer than a dozen words.
People will forget most of what you say so you need to pick carefully what you want to stick.
It’s the seed you want to plant in their heads.

## Hero's Journey

The talk follows a double hero journey.
It's walked through on the theory side and then again, in order, in the demo.

- Establish some conflict or a problem to get the viewer interested.
  - Engineering pains. Technical debt. Developer frustration.
  - _Intro to demo for codebase_
- Walk them through the main "aha" moment. (The "what" of my talk.)
  - Viewing CI as a natural component of self-validating good explanations.
  - _Build test watcher_
  - _Do "exploratory driven development" with a combination of REPL and tests_
    - Does this one block of code work? Yes? Ok, merge it.
  - _Test the documentation_
  - High energy pay-off: Feeling the "flow" of instant feedback.
- Recap how what we did solves the posed problem.
  - Once you have CI, you have an objective oracle for validation
- Finish it off with something that appeals to emotions (The “why” of my talk)
  - Symmathesy
  - Aretê
