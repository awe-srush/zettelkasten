# Self-Validating Good Explanations

The ultimate goal of any software development company should be to foster an environment of creating self-validating [[[b0e2139c]]].

- Software development is an act of creativity
- Software development happens in a [[[5a328c3e]]]
- [[[f0e1b602]]] is a process one must continually work to get better at
- Software development is a process of discovery
  - All languages are turing complete. What matters, then? Optimizing for the creation of "Good Explanations"
  - As "Good Explanations" are a process of discovery, optimizing for them is optimizing for learning
    - Learning happens in a state of flow. [[2032d600]]
    - Learning requires discovery, and also requires teaching and sharing of knowledge. [[06e5698f]]
    - A good explanation approach to software development culminates in a verification driven approach (TDD, verification, etc)
    - This approach, when automated and applied to an entire project, results in [[[3e3c8463]]]
  - Science is humanity's most effective approach to learning: Methodical formulation of Good Explanations.
  - Defining characteristic of Good Explanations is that they are hard to vary without invalidating them. Thus, they are also falsifiable and testable.
  - Engineering is the science of applying science to solving practical problems.
