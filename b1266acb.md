# Blog Ideas

- Devops position hiring post
- Deep Dive into building the world offline (nix shell + centos-sandbox)
- Rust mono-repo CI

I was originally planning on doing a lightning talk, but with the demand being high, I'm going to do a dev talk instead. Is there anything people would like to hear about? I can do something more immediately concrete (like an overview of how I accomplished something), or more theoretical, or even a blend. Some ideas I've been floating in my head for a while to give a talk on are:

On the more concrete side of things:

- Infrastructure as code: making ovirt and terraform behave
- Building fully offline sandboxes and caches using nix
- Haskell repo with submodules: From 3 build systems to 1
- Rust mono-repo: haha code code make CI go brrrr

On the more theoretical side of things:

- CI pipeline best practices
- Ergonomics: strategies for optimizing feedback loops and making programs/libraries easier to use, build, deploy, and contribute to
- Explaining DevOps as a cultural shift
- The Nature of Software Delivery
