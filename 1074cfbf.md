# Continuous Integration

- CI should be stateless
- CI should be transient and ephemeral
- CI should be idempotent
- CI should be quick to start up cold
- CI should ideally be minimal
- CI should be sound. Completeness is impossible
- Testing pipelines should be quick. They should finish by the time someone commits, opens a browser, goes to the repository, and looks at the results of their pipeline. 20-30 seconds, ideally.
  - Not everything needs to be tested every time
  - Not every test needs to run on every code change
  - Compiling can be done incrementally if caches are configured well
  - There are 3 tiers of tests. Each corresponds to the context required to test a falsifiable assertion of a Good Explanation.
    - Warning: [This article](https://medium.com/telostouch/why-we-ditched-unit-tests-for-integration-end-to-end-tests-80a86e0ca397) shows why it's important to write even the logic tests within the context of Good Explanations.
    - As a general rule, the more stateless an application is, and the less IO it does, the more its total complexity can be tested with pure logic tests.
    - Logic: Stateless, idempotent. No IO or threading. (`<1ms`) 70%
      - Ex: Unit tests, Generative testing
    - Interface: Stateless, Idempotent. (`<1s`) 20%
      - Composition of logic preserves semantics
      - Tests composition invariants that can't be represented in the type system
    - Environment/Context. "The full thing" (no limit) 10%
      - Tests things as fully and interactively as possible from the perspective of the end user (ie their full environment with their full context)
  - Schedule tests and CI runs. Run Env/Context tests nightly.
  - Use branches as control flow. Example: Use CI to auto merge to the "staged" branch. Test the staged branch. Auto merge to master if it passes the long nightly test suite.
- Compiling should ideally be reproducible
- CI test results should be ergonomically reproducible in a development environment
