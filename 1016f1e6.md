# Properties of Build Systems.

- Minimality: build a task only once and only if their dependencies have changed.
  - Must rebuild only out of date keys and at most once
  - Must build all keys in an order that respects their dependencies
- [[[cb92f30c]]]
- [[[89077804]]]
- [[[b4965ecf]]]
- [[[2c7c8fd4]]]
- Self Tracking: tracks changes in task definitions themselves
- Early Cutoff optimization: don't try to build dependant tasks if a task execution has unchanged result
- Shallow Builds: Materialize only end build products locally
- Content Addressable Cache: maps hash of file content to actual content
- Memo table: record all build commands with input and output file hashes.
- [[[823d367b]]]
- Hermicity: Dependent only on a known set of inputs, which is essential for ensuring that builds are reproducible.
  - nb: achieved in bazel by disallowing arbitrary IO
- "Very fast incremental builds"
