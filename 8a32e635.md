# DevOps Topologies

Different teams and topologies have differing levels of effectieness.
Some are very effective, some are conditionally effective, and some are so commonly ineffective that they are known as anti-patterns.

Throughout the common effective topologies, and examining the small differences between some types of effective teams and their ineffective "variants," a few patterns emerge:
[[[fad84c12]]] contains some useful advice for spotting signs of ineffective topologies; the differences are mostly in culture, which is why high performing teams view [[9db9e634]] as a cultural movement.

- Early Ops involvement and collaboration in application development lifecycle is essential to prevent costly technical debt from racking up.
- Attempting to shoehorn ops skills and activities into a project can end up costing a lot of time and investment.
- [[9db9e634]] requires human communication skills to thrive in an organization.
- Ops inside dev teams can lead to half-baked solutions as ops is treated as an annoyance for devs.

To combat some deficiencies:

- Consult with Ops early to structure applications accordingly
- Develop strong communication skills
- Recognize the need for ops and the benefits it can provide to all types of projects
