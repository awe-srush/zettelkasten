# Project Metrics

As one works on [[f0e1b602]], there needs to be a way to analyze the work that's being done and to reason about it.
Otherwise, [[01682ccb]] won't happen and it will become harder and harder to know that your software is a [[b0e2139c]].
Even more so if you desire for your [[b0e2139c]]s to be [[234c9e0e]].

For performers of a project, it can be helpful to think of the project as its own entity that has a concept of health.
After all a project has its own [[05e161ab]], and the desired environment should be intentionally cultivated.
Healthy environments have teams with high [[d99dc068]], which empowers them to have and enrich an already [[30b3f2cc]].

A healthy project is one that wants to be worked on, that invites others to work on it, that sparks interest and natural inquisitive curiosity in those that investigate it.
Further, it can sustain that interest even as a performer gets to know the project more intimately and seeks to improve it and work on it.

### Age of oldest tested codepath

- Are there workflows that essentially nobody uses? Should there be?
- Are they tested to make sure they're not broken?
- "Who broke the windows builds four weeks ago and why didn't we notice until now?" - PL of team that doesn't use Windows
- The good thing about haskell: Breaking it is harder than average. The bad thing about haskell: Now you have to actually test your error-path code--pushing to production may be insufficient.

### Documentation that can't lie

> Oh, you know I'm on tonight, and my hips don't lie
> And I am starting to feel it's right
> The attraction, the tension
> Baby, like this is perfection

Questions to ask regarding [[9dfd2fe7]].

- Can your documentation break the build if it doesn't get updated?
- How do you document more of your process?
- Documentation that can be run to "give you the thing" (eg docs on a dev environment that give you the dev environment)

### Hot Path Feedback Loop

> Can you hear me now? Good. Can you hear me now? Good. Can you hear me now?

Aspects of [[2bc613de]] to investigate.

- Code in an editor
- Local stuff
- Remote stuff
- Stuff that breaks a cache (takes you off the hotpath)
- MTTR (Mean Time to Repair)

### How many licks does it take to lick a lollipop

> Sometimes automating a task is worth it, not because it's done frequently, but precisely because it's not

Tasks to think about optimizing.

- Release a new version. [[6bb1a622]]. [[5c500d4f]].
- [[fc2903e4]]
- Reset an environment ([[65c218b2]], [[e11c37e0]])
- Add a new machine to CI/CD ([[ba270fd9]])

### Toss a Coin to Your Customer

> All I wanna say is that, they don't really care about us

- Percent complete and accurate (%C&A): How often is work delivered where the customer doesn't have to correct, add, or clarify information.
