# DevOps Topology Type 8: Container-Driven Collaboration

Rather than building an explicit [[9db9e634]] team; this topology focuses on encoding knowledge into a reusable abstraction that both dev and ops know.
Building reproducible environments and/or containers inside the Dev teams can remove the need for some types of continued collaboration betwen dev and ops.
Containers and reproducible environments effectively codify deployment and runtime requirements of an application into the environment.
However, containers must be created with an eye towards Ops concerns.

Key point: codifying deployment and runtime requirements, not necessarily _all_ possible permutation of environment requirements.
