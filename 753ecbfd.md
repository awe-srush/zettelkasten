# Thought Management

Generalizes task Management, SRS, knowledge management, etc.

Andy has been doing good work on this.
https://www.patreon.com/posts/bringing-ideas-36925173 goes into good detail.

https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1311031980595658752 links to https://www.patreon.com/posts/40672377 which is an excellent post, intrinsically tied to withOrbit (although not directly).

Given your practice of actualism (slash buddhism?), you may be very interested in this[1] which is linked to in the patreon post as the natural generalization of SRS/memory systems https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2gqazXUkf9qyFjMQg4W3dw6yegnAJszvDywN

And lastly, I think a natural train of thought connecting all of these is:

curiosity -> desire to organize knowledge -> desire to optimize knowledge ingestion/retention -> desire to optimize actions (of which "knowledge ingestion, curation, retention, etc.," is just a single category) -> curiosity

with the caveat that, being so tied together, I can imagine this being more naturally realized as a fully connected graph of connections rather than a "linear" one
