# Documentation

Documentation is something that's a part of the environment and context.
As such, it' s just as important, if not even more so, than the code itself.
Like code, it is a precise Good Explanation; however, unlike code, it cannot be computationally verified the same way.
Rather than being a downside, it offers an opportunity to express ideas in non-computational form which can ease understanding.

- Treat documentation like code. Whenever possible make it falsifiable.
  - Falsifiable documentation is testable
  - Copy and pasted examples should compile with the expected result
  - [See Microsoft's Azure site for an example of excellent docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/)
- Documentation often ends up being written as an unstructured graph. Whenever possible, restructure it back into a tree.
  - Restructuring in this case means offering and presenting traversals of the information in tree forms.
  - New users require information in a linear format
  - Returning users want to remember a minimal path to get to certain documentation. Trees are easier to remember than graphs because they lack cycles and have a clear direction.
