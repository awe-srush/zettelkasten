# CI/CD Platform Ergonomics

- Having auto resume from latest passing stage is possible with explicit inputs/outputs.
- In fact, you can automatically reuse caches without having to explicitly state it as long as everything is tracked.
- Effectively addressing [[39ab863d]]
- Local builds and local feedback loops with same code/env as CI
- [[f6df43cd]]
