# Platform

> A digital platform is a foundation of self-service APIs, tools, services, knowledge and support which are arranged as a compelling internal product.
> Autonomous delivery teams can make use of the platform to deliver product features at a higher pace, with reduced co-ordination.

Self service is a key characteristic for a good platform.
It should allow for self-service provisioning, configuration, management, and operation of the platform capabilities and assets.
