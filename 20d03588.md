# Properties of CI/CD/CC

This will be a summarization of short bullet point properties of what make a good CI/CD infrastructure.
It'll be mostly a priori knowledge that I'll pull back into the rest of the thoughts, but for now I need to just get it out so I have something to show.
First, there can be no CI/CD without an environment to run that CI in.
The physical properties of what you are testing are going to determine how to think about the CI/CD pipeline.
In short, the CI/CD is as transparent as possible.
It should be quick, sound, reliable, and helpful.
For tests, it's important to remember that they are testing [[234c9e0e]].

Many tests are often required per Good Explanation, where each test (usually) corresponds to an individual assertion.
