# Trunk Based Development

While often hyped and misapplied, at its core, trunk-based development is about trying to optimize for the Consistency in [[2202edf0]].
This consistency allows for team members to most rapidly and effecively work towards [[f0e1b602]].

- VCS Hygiene:
  - Always true: No commit to master may break the build.
- You have two options for branching strategy:
  - Easier for CI: Trunk based development.
    - Requires more discipline and tighter coordination.
    - Demands fast CI for most effective workflows.
    - Needs very small, concrete tasks. One day max per task, ideally.
    - Has different models
    - Pushing directly to master doesn't mean it's actually going to land; the CI can still verify it.
  - Integrates most naturally with Git-Lab: Short-lived feature branch
    - Can also be a workflow of trunk based development
